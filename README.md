## Getting Started

Mynth is using pnpm as package manager and moon as a task runner. You can use moon either via dev dependency installed by pnpm, or directly via shell. The choice is your, but we recommend sticking to pnpm and use commands via pnpm.

### Running app in development mode

#### Using pnpm

Clone the repository, make sure you have `pnpm` installed and run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Run commands
pnpm dev
```

#### Using moon directly

Install moon:

```bash
brew install moon
```

Run the development server:

```bash
moon dev
```

**_Note that there's no need to run `install` command, as moon will automatically install dependencies._**

### Useful paths
