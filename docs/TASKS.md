# Mynth — Tasks (repo tracker)

## Status tags

- `BACKLOG` — good idea, not scheduled
- `NEXT` — queued up
- `IN_PROGRESS` — actively being built
- `BLOCKED` — waiting on a decision/spike
- `DONE` — shipped/merged

## How to use

- Each ticket is a small, mergeable slice (ideally <=1–2 days).
- Prefer adding Acceptance bullets (binary done/not done).
- Keep dependencies explicit.
