## Model configuration

```ts
type ModelConfig = {
  /*
    The id of the model.
    This one is autogenrated by the app.

    We allow to have same model defined twice,
    we don't want to limitate users in any way
    in terms of configuration.
  */
  id: string; // Autogenerated by the app

  /*
    The id of the model in the provider.

    This id, will be model ID used by the provider.
    For example: "llama3:8b"

    This will be used in requests to API, as well
    as recgnizing the model by the app for common
    models information.
  */
  modelId: string;

  /*
    The name of the model.

    This name, will be used by the app to display the model.
    For example: "LLama 3.1 8B"

    This will be set by user, but can be suggested by the app,
    as well as plugins will have it set automatically.
  */
  name: string;

  /*
    The type of the model.
  */
  type: "TEXT_GENERATION" | "TEXT_TO_IMAGE" | "IMAGE_TO_TEXT";
};
